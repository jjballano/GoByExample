# GoByExample

Project used to follow the hand-on introduction of Go https://gobyexample.com/ but doing some more stuff sometimes in order to test more thing I want to know.

I'm not worried about project structure or good practices yet, just trying to learn the sintaxis. I'm learning conventions (variables or functions names, etc) during the lessons, so I could be wrong sometimes until I find the proper way to do it.

To install go => https://golang.org/doc/install

To run a program:

```
  go run src/hello-world.go
``` 

To build an executable:

```
  go build src/hello-world.go
``` 

To run an executable:

```
  ./hello-world
```
