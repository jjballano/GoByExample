# GoByExample

Project used to follow the hand-on introduction of Go https://gobyexample.com/
I'm not worried about project structure or good practices yet, just trying to learn the sintaxis.

To install go => https://golang.org/doc/install

To run a program:

```
  go run src/hello-world.go
``` 

To build an executable:

```
  go build src/hello-world.go
``` 

To run an executable:

```
  ./hello-world
```
